                    <p>
                      My third client with Scout was Contuity, a note-taking tool that focuses on helping people stay
                      connected. The app is designed for people who have a lot of relationships to keep track of and
                      want to prevent people from slipping through the cracks. Unlike other apps already on the market,
                      Contuity aims to be supportive, encouraging, and mindful. Contuity knows how busy its users are
                      and wants to alleviate the pressure so that the user feels in control.

                    <h3 className='h4'>Discovery</h3>
                    <p>
                      The first step in the process was understanding what Contuity was and wasn't and how that compares
                      to what already exists. With ideas from the client and pre-existing applications, we conducted two
                      different styles of interviews. One focused on how extremely busy people currently keep track of
                      all their connections and things they need to get done, while the other focused more on what
                      features people wanted to stay organized.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      My team and I were able to collaborate on the questions and strategy, which led to us creating a
                      user test plan. Each of us followed this plan and conducted three interviews with people involved
                      in multiple organizations, worked several jobs, or who were just generally busy. This gave us a
                      wealth of information. Below are some of the questions we asked and an example of the results from
                      the sorting exercise.

                    <p>
                      Through these interviews, we were able to gain insight into the hectic lives of several people.
                      These user interviews led to the creation of personas. We narrowed our users down to four main
                      types of people...
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                      <li>
                        <b>A young entrepreneur with a full-time marketing job.</b> This person is actively networking
                        inside and outside of the office and is constantly meeting new people. They need a way to
                        remember everyone and keep track of their thoughts. They use LinkedIn to connect with other
                        professionals, as well as Slack and Outlook to communicate with co-workers. To manage their
                        personal life, they use Google products.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <b>A working professional who travels frequently for work.</b> They are building new
                        relationships all the time, with people from all over the world. They need to organize meetings
                        within a tight schedule and maintain steady client relationships and communications. They are
                        comfortable on the computer, but also keep a notebook of important information to remember.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <b>Highly motivated and busy college student. </b> They need to keep up with rigorous course
                        work and coordinate events for the student organization they are a part of. They have to balance
                        work and social life and use Google and Apple products to do so. They are active on social media
                        and use that as a way to connect to people.

                        household tasks, as well as keep track of their children's events like sports, music lessons,
                        and Parent-Teacher meetings. They coordinate events for a local volunteer group and need a way
                        to keep in touch with members. They constantly have their hands full and need a quick way to jot
                        things down.

                    <h3 className='h4'>Wireframing</h3>
                    <p>
                      With all this research and information from our client, it was time to decide on what features we
                      wanted to include and how the user would interact with them. Initially we planned to wireframe the
                      whole app, where we would lay out a few screens each week. However, we quickly ran into issues,
                      such as features not connecting and inconsistency between the designs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      After taking a week to regroup and assess the first few weeks of work, we decided that since this
                      project had a very large scope, we should focus on adding one feature per week and perfecting that
                      flow. For example, during week 1 of this new plan, each designer worked on a flow for creating a
                      note.
                    </p>
                  </Grid>
                  <Grid item xs={12}>
                    <blockquote>
                      Though very basic, Contuity as an app could not function on any level if there was no ability to
                      create a note.
                    </blockquote>
                  </Grid>
                  <Grid item xs={12} sm={10} md={8}>
                    <p>
                      With three designers, we were also able to ideate through different ways to complete this action.
                      Where does the button to add a note live, what does the empty state look like, how does a user
                      view all their notes? These were areas where our wireframes and flows differed. However, at the
                      end of each week, we spoke about our decisions and decided which aspects of each should be
                      included. I then took our screens and made the "final" set of wireframes. This process was much
                      more manageable and let us make sure everything worked the way it should.

                      As I continued to work on wireframes, two other designers on my team tackled the UI. I served as a
                      mentor for them and provided support and critique. Throughout the wireframing and UI design
                      process, we made sure to design in a "component" manner to be mindful of future development
                      efforts. I was also able to advocate for accessible design and continued to remind the designers
                      of the considerations we needed to take.

                      developers in mind.

                      Once I wrapped up the wireframes, I was able to begin creating a front-end system based on the
                      designs. Using React Native, I created a flexible design system that included our set colors, text
                      hierarchy, and basic reusable elements such as note cards, input fields, and buttons. Although I
                      wasn't able to style all of the flows built out by the developers, I was able to create a strong
                      base for future developers to utilize.

                      Working on Contuity was an amazing experience. As a more experienced design team member, I was
                      able to mentor new team members, while also receiving help from the more knowledgable developers!
                      I was able to push myself while working on the wireframes to create a cohesive and meditative
                      experience for our users. I got to make sure our app was designed with accessibility in mind and
                      teach my team members key standards.

                      Additionally, I had no prior experience with React Native so I am extremely thankful for the
                      kindness and patience my development team showed me while I learned the ropes. This was also my
                      first time developing something I didn't design. I got to understand the frustrations developers
                      face when designers continue to make changes to screens and components they previously said were
                      complete. I learned about development processes such as PRs and merge conflicts and got more
                      familiar with GitHub, Git and Terminal!

                      If there was one thing I could change, I wish we would have been able to add features like seeing
                      progress and including more fun, celebratory aspects in our app. Our app could have been more
                      friendly and encouraging with these features, but we, unfortunately, ran out of time.
