                    <p>
                      BevSpot is software used by the food and beverage industry to streamline operations. From placing
                      orders and taking inventory to tracking sales, BevSpot provides a platform for its users to better
                      understand their establishment. Throughout BevSpot's development, different areas of the app are
                      updated to include new features. When I was tasked with improving the Ordering feature, it hadn't
                      been touched since the initial launch nearly 5 years ago! On top of needing to make major UX
                      improvements, the team also wanted to include a way to connect with global vendors like Sysco.
                      Working with a Project Manager, I was tasked with doing an overhaul of our ordering flow. This
                      included completing user research, wireframing solutions and testing them at various stages, and
                      then creating high fidelity screens using BevSpot's new brand.

                    <p>
                      After our kick-off meeting, I immediately deep dove into the current ordering flow. Having
                      experience in a professional kitchen helped me immediately catch some UX issues. After noting my
                      experience, I turned to FullStory to see where our users were getting stuck. Then I did a
                      competitive analysis on both mobile and desktop to understand how our competitors have tried to
                      streamline the ordering process.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      With all this research, it was time to reach out to our users. BevSpot has several vocal customers
                      who love to provide feedback and their ideas so I was able to connect with them to hear what
                      changes they wanted to see in our ordering flow.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      During these calls, it became very clear the biggest issue was ordering in different units (i.e.
                      750 ML vs 1L bottle) and having multiple vendors for one item (i.e. broccoli can be purchased from
                      many places). Our current product provided no solution for these problems so it was clear this
                      would be a good place to start.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      From these chats and my own research, I created a user research report which I presented to the
                      main stakeholders to validate 1) the need for this update and 2) the scale of this project and its
                      affect on the rest of the product

                  <Grid item xs={12} sm={10} md={8}>
                    <h3 className='h4'>Wireframing</h3>
                    <p>
                      With all of this research, it was time to start coming up with possible solutions. We began by
                      whiteboarding ideas during Design Team meetings and just throwing out whatever we thought. Below
                      is an example of a whiteboard exercise we did for adding items from different vendors, like Sysco
                      or BevSpot's default catalog.
                    </p>
                    <img
                      src={require('../../../assets/imgs/projects/bevspot/1.JPG')}

                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <p>
                      These meetings provided valuable ideas and a base for my first round of wireframes. Throughout the
                      wireframing process, I conducted two more rounds of user testing with internal teammates and the
                      users we initially spoke with. This provided a consistent stream of feedback to incorporate into
                      my work.

                      After finalizing the user interaction, it was time to apply our new brand to these screens. During
                      this phase, I had the opportunity to make this flow feel less overwhelming and support the user
                      through the new process I had designed. Below is a sample of the final screens for the updated
                      ordering process.

                    <p>
                      Though this product update was never launched, I learned so much about the process of providing
                      new updates to users. It is so easy to be on the user side and just think "Wow it would have been
                      so much better if the team did X over Y", but being on the product side showed how much thought,
                      research, and effort goes into every interaction. I also learned more about advocating for
                      accessible design and better UX in a professional setting where budget and time constraints are a
                      real concern.

                    <p>
                      If this were to have launched, to consider my redesign successful I would have wanted to see the
                      following:

                    <ol>
                      <li>An increase in users placing orders through BevSpot</li>
                      <li>
                        A decrease in the average number of items in a user's account (items like 750mL and 1L bottles
                        of the same product could now be combined to one item)
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Users utilizing the Sysco catalog to place orders with Sysco through BevSpot (not possible in
