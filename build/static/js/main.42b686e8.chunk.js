They could add money to their Amazon account in-store and use that credit online. While we were no tech giant like Amazon, their solution proposed meeting in person to finalize the purchase. To make this solution work for Mass Hike, I needed to design a way for two people to meet in a designated place. Through a previous connection with Boston Centers for Youth & Families, we were able to use their locations as a meeting spot. From there, I designed a calendar system that allowed Mass Hike team members to input when they were free and then a user could book that time and pick their nearest Boston Centers for Youth & Families as the meeting place.
